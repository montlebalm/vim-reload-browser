This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

INTRODUCTION                                    *reload-browser*

This plugin is designed to help you stay focused on your editor while updating
web code. Tools like LiveReload can do this automatically, but they require
setup on each project.

MAPPINGS                                        *reload-browser-mappings*

No mappings are defined by default. Define the sequence of your choosing and
execute the `ReloadBrowser()` function exposed by this plugin.

>
  nnoremap <silent> <leader>rs :call ReloadBrowser()<CR>
<

CUSTOMIZING                                     *reload-browser-customizing*

No browsers are targeted by default. You'll need to specify which of the
supported applications are reloaded.

Currently only Safari and Google Chrome are supported. The possible options
are:

>
  let g:reload_browser_chrome = 1
  let g:reload_browser_safari = 1
